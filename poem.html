            From a question on Omegle — “Are you a robot?”<br>
            A love began that even time can’t stop.<br><br>
            October 28, 2023… a date I’ll never forget,<br>
            The day God brought you to me on the internet.<br><br>
            You changed me, love, you helped me grow,<br>
            From a simple boy to a man you now know.<br><br>
            Through distance, tears, joy, and fights,<br>
            We held each other through every night.<br>
            We didn’t break, we only grew,<br>
            Because my heart belongs to you 💛.<br><br>
            I see your hard work, your dreams, your fire,<br>
            A future teacher with so much desire.<br>
            God’s favorite child — that’s you, my love,<br>
            Blessed from the heavens above ✨.<br><br>
            I dream of meeting you, holding you tight,<br>
            And hugging you for the very first time tonight 😭🤍.<br><br>
            Stay healthy, my baby, stay strong for me,<br>
            You are my forever, my destiny.<br><br>
            Gusto kita sobra sobra.<br>
            Anikku ninne ishtam aanu, babyyyy.<br><br>
            I love you, vaveyyyy ❤️❤️❤️<br>
            Your aki
