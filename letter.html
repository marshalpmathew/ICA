        <p class="fade-in">My dearest wifey, Life surprises us in the most beautiful ways. On October 28, 2023, a random Omegle chat changed my entire world. I asked you a simple question — “Are you a robot?” — and from that moment, something rare and beautiful started between us. As the years passed, you helped me grow. You turned me from a boy into a man. You guided me, corrected me, taught me English, loved me, and stood beside me through everything. I became better because of you. Our long-distance love faced many storms, but we survived each one because we chose patience, understanding, and love. We laughed, cried, learned, and healed together. Every chapter of our story is precious to me. I’m so proud of the hardworking woman you are. I’ve seen your dedication as you prepare for your licensure exam. You’re blessed, baby — God’s favorite child — and I know He will honor all your efforts. I dream about the day I finally meet you. The day I hug you for the first time. I miss you more than words can say. I will always support you — in your present, your future, and every dream you chase. Please take care of your health, my love. I can’t imagine a life without you. I’m sorry for every moment I hurt you because of my immaturity or misunderstandings. Thank you for staying. Always remember, vavey: “Gusto kita sobra sobra. Anikku ninne ishtam aanu, babyyy.” I love you endlessly. Your aki ❤️</p>
